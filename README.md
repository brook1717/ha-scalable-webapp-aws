This project demonstrates a production-style, highly available and scalable web application architecture on AWS. It showcases deep understanding of VPC design, multi-AZ deployment, Auto Scaling, load balancing, and database high availability using Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ). The infrastructure is built inside a custom VPC spanning two Availability Zones, with properly segmented public and private subnets, NAT Gateways for secure outbound access, an Application Load Balancer distributing traffic to an EC2 Auto Scaling Group, and CloudWatch alarms for monitoring. Security is enforced using IAM roles, Security Groups, and Network ACLs. This project reflects real-world cloud architecture principles and demonstrates practical knowledge beyond simply launching EC2 instances.
